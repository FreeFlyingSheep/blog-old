## Github 模板

仓库的维护者可以添加模板，来帮助贡献者创建高质量的 Issue 和 Pull request。

### Issue 模板

#### Issue 模板介绍

Issue 模板放置于 `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` 文件夹，里面可以创建 `config.yml` 来配置模板选择器。

`config.yml` 的官方示例如下：

```yaml
blank_issues_enabled: false
contact_links:
  - name: GitHub Community Support
    url: https://github.community/
    about: Please ask and answer questions here.
  - name: GitHub Security Bug Bounty
    url: https://bounty.github.com/
    about: Please report security vulnerabilities here.
```

`blank_issues_enabled` 选项用于配置是否允许发起空 Issue。

`contact_links` 用于指定一些额外的链接，比如有些问题不属于该项目，而是相关工具的问题，可以让用户去那些工具的官网提 Issue。

#### Issue 模板实例

[Pro Git, Second Edition](https://github.com/progit/progit2) 项目的 `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` 文件如下：

```yaml
contact_links:
  - name: Translation bug
    url: https://github.com/progit/progit2/blob/master/TRANSLATING.md
    about: Refer to this table to find out where to report translation bugs.

  - name: Report bugs for git-scm.com site
    url: https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/issues/
    about: Please report problems with the git-scm.com site here.

  - name: Bug is about Git program itself
    url: https://git-scm.com/community
    about: Please report problems with the Git program here.

  - name: Bug is about Git for Windows
    url: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues
    about: Please report problems with Git for Windows here.
```

该项目新建 Issue 的页面如下：

其中，只有第一个 `Bug report` 是项目里添加的模板，位于 `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`，内容如下：

```markdown

### Pull request 模板

#### Pull request 模板介绍

Pull request 模板可以放置于 `docs` 目录或者 `.github` 目录。

如果只需要单一的模板，创建 `docs/pull_request_template.md` 或者 `.github/pull_request_template.md` 文件即可。

如果需要多个模板，将模板集中放置于 `docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` 或者 `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` 文件夹。

#### Pull request 模板实例

[Pro Git, Second Edition](https://github.com/progit/progit2) 项目的 Pull request 模板位于 `.github/pull_request_template.md`，内容如下：

```markdown
<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->
<!-- Before you start on a large rewrite or other major change: open a new issue first, to discuss the proposed changes. -->
<!-- Should your changes appear in a printed edition, you'll be included in the contributors list. -->

<!-- Mark the checkbox [X] or [x] if you agree with the item. -->
